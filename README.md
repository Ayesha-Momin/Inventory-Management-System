Inventory Management System

The Inventory Management System is a Java console application designed to automate and simplify product management for small to medium-scale businesses. It enables key operations such as adding, updating, deleting, searching, and displaying products, along with generating low-stock reports.

The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. A `Product` class defines properties like ID, name, quantity, and price, while the `Inventory` class manages collections of products and implements all business logic. This modular approach ensures code reusability and clarity.

Product data is stored in in-memory collections (`ArrayList`), providing fast access and manipulation during runtime. The system can be extended to use file-based or database storage for persistence, allowing data to be saved and reloaded across sessions.

The application is menu-driven, offering a simple console interface for users to interact with. Users can easily perform operations like adding new products, updating details, searching by ID, deleting products, viewing all items, and generating low-stock reports.

Exception handling ensures robustness by managing invalid inputs and operations on non-existent products. The project demonstrates practical application of Java concepts such as classes, objects, collections, methods, loops, and input handling.

Overall, the Inventory Management System provides a practical solution for real-world inventory management, helping businesses maintain accurate records, optimize stock levels, and make informed decisions, while also serving as a strong learning project for core Java programming.
